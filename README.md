# CPU-using-12-bit-registers
In this project, I implemented a CPU that consists of 8 registers through each of which we can read and write data. I also implemented an Arithmetic and Logical unit(ALU) using Verilog for doing integer and floating point operations, which takes input and writes the output to the register files.
